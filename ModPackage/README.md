# VB Can mod
 
Direct modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

Alters the integration method of more emotes to work better with CheckConditionsForEmote

Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)

Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)
