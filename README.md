# BetterEmotes

Moving from 1.0.x to 1.1.x changes the config layout.

Modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

- Moves keybindings into the settings page (as of 1.1.0)
- Adds config values to alter change emote cooldown and griddy move speed (as of 1.1.0)
- Alters the integration method of more emotes to work better with CheckConditionsForEmote (not really needed anymore but its still there)

- Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)

- Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)
