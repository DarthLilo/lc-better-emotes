# BetterEmotes

## Issues (incompatiblities)

Players might find some inconsistant behaviour with TooManyEmotes. I have altered the code to allow compatiblity with TooManyEmotes but i have no control over how the two interact and am working towards a fix. More emotes works slightly better but also has issues.

Moving from 1.0.x to 1.1.x changes the config layout.

Modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

- Moves keybindings into the settings page, still has config values for defaults for modpacks
- Makes center of emote wheel not change emote
- Adds config values to alter change emote cooldown and griddy move speed (as of 1.1.0)
- Add config to add option to stop emote when on outer circle of emote wheel
- Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)

- Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)
